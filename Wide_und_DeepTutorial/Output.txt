WARNING:tensorflow:enqueue_data was called with num_epochs and num_threads > 1. num_epochs is applied per thread, so this will produce more epochs than you probably intend. If you want to limit epochs, use one thread.
WARNING:tensorflow:enqueue_data was called with shuffle=False and num_threads > 1. This will create multiple threads, all reading the array/dataframe in order. If you want examples read in order, use one thread; if you want multiple threads, enable shuffling.
